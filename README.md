## Introduction üî∞

![](https://github.com/paragon-tech001/IMDB-movies-visualization/blob/main/IMDB_Logo.png)

In this report, I present a comprehensive data visualization project based on the IMDB movies dataset. The project aims to uncover and display key performance indicators (KPIs) related to movies, such as top movies by votes, distribution of movie certificates, trends in movie releases over the years, and performance metrics by genre. Using interactive dashboards created in Tableau, I aim to provide valuable insights into the movie industry, leveraging the rich data available in the IMDB dataset.

## Problem Statement üíº

_The primary goal of this project is to visualize key metrics from the IMDB movies dataset to derive insights and identify trends. Specifically, I seek to answer the following questions:_
- Which movies have received the highest number of votes?
- How are movie certificates distributed among the dataset?
- What are the trends in the number of movies released each year?
- How do IMDB ratings and Meta scores vary among the top 10 genres?
- What are the gross earnings trends over the years?
- How can these visualizations help stakeholders in the movie industry?

## Skills Demonstrated :books: 

_Through this project, I demonstrate my proficiency in:_
- Data extraction and transformation from a complex dataset.
- Creating calculated fields and aggregating data to generate meaningful insights.
- Designing and implementing interactive dashboards in Tableau.
- Applying best practices in data visualization to convey information effectively.
- Analyzing trends and patterns in movie data to draw actionable conclusions.

## Data Sourcing And Transformation ‚ÑπÔ∏è

The data for this project was sourced from the IMDB dataset, which includes comprehensive information about movies, such as their titles, release years, genres, IMDB ratings, Meta scores, number of votes, gross earnings, and certificates. This dataset is publicly available and widely used for movie-related analyses.

_To prepare the data for visualization, I performed the following steps:_
- Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, corrected inconsistencies, and handled missing values.
- Normalization: Standardized genres, titles, and other categorical data to ensure consistency.
- Aggregation: Calculated total votes, average ratings, Meta scores, and gross earnings by genre and year.
- Derived Metrics: Created additional fields such as top 10 movies by votes and average scores by genre.

## Analysis and Visualization üíπ
